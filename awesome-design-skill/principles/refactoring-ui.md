# Refactoring UI Principles

## Starting From Scratch
- Start with a functional goal, not a layout
- Deal with the details later
- Don't over-design
- Give your interface a distinct personality
- Limit your choices

## Hierarchy is Everything
- Not all elements are equally important
- Size isn't everything
- Don't use grey text on colored backgrounds
- Emphasize by de-emphasizing
- Labels are a last resort
- Separate visual hierarchy from document structure
- Balance weight and contrast
- Semantics are secondary

## Layout and Spacing
- Start with too much white space
- Establish a spacing and sizing system
- You don't have to fill the whole screen
- Grids are overrated
- Relative sizing doesn't scale
- Avoid ambiguous spacing

## Designing Text
- Establish a type scale
- Use high-quality fonts
- Control reasonable line lengths
- Align to the baseline, not the center
- Line height is proportional to font size
- Not every link needs a color
- Align for readability
- Use letter-spacing appropriately

## Working with Color
- Stop using hex, use HSL
- You need more colors than you think
- Define shades up front
- Avoid desaturating by changing lightness
- Grey doesn't have to be pure grey
- Accessible doesn't mean ugly
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information

## Creating Depth
- Emulate a single light source
- Use shadows to convey elevation
- Shadows can have multiple layers
- Even flat design has depth
- Overlap elements to create layers

## Working with Images
- Use high-quality imagery
- Text needs a consistent contrast
- Every element has an intended size
- Handle user-uploaded content with caution

## Finishing Touches
- Supercharge the defaults
- Add color with accent borders
- Beautify backgrounds appropriately
- Don't forget empty states
- Reduce border usage
- Think outside the box
